## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the monitoring setup for the EPAI platform. It covers the dashboards, alerts, and operational procedures for monitoring the system.

## Dashboards

### System Overview Dashboard

The System Overview dashboard provides a high-level view of the EPAI platform's health and performance. It includes the following metrics:

- API request volume
- Response times
- Error rates
- Database performance
- Edge Function execution statistics

### API Performance Dashboard

The API Performance dashboard focuses specifically on the performance of the EPAI API endpoints. It includes:

- Response times by endpoint
- Error rates by endpoint
- Request volume by endpoint
- Cache hit rates

## Alerts

### High Error Rate Alert

Triggers when the error rate exceeds 5% over a 5-minute period.

**Response Procedure:**
1. Check the logs for error patterns
2. Verify if a recent deployment correlates with the increase
3. Check external dependencies for outages
4. Rollback to previous version if necessary

### High Latency Alert

Triggers when the average API response time exceeds 200ms over a 5-minute period.

**Response Procedure:**
1. Check database performance
2. Verify Edge Function execution times
3. Check for unusual traffic patterns
4. Scale resources if necessary

## Operational Procedures

### Daily Monitoring Checks

1. Review all dashboards at the start of the day
2. Check for any triggered alerts in the last 24 hours
3. Verify that all critical services are operational
4. Review any scheduled maintenance activities

### Incident Response

1. Acknowledge the alert
2. Investigate the root cause
3. Mitigate the immediate issue
