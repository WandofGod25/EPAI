## 🚀 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### Database Optimizations
```sql
-- Performance indexes for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_logs_created_at ON logs(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_insights_created_at ON insights(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_models_status ON models(status);

-- Composite indexes for common patterns
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_logs_partner_created ON logs(partner_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_insights_partner_created ON insights(partner_id, created_at DESC);
```

### Caching Implementation
```typescript
// React hook with intelligent caching
export function useOptimizedData<T>(
  queryFn: () => Promise<T>,
  options: UseOptimizedDataOptions
) {
  // Cache management with expiration
  // Request cancellation with AbortController
  // Automatic refetch intervals
  // Error handling and loading states
}
```

```typescript
// Real-time performance tracking
interface PerformanceMetric {
  endpoint_name: string;
  response_time_ms: number;
  status_code: number;
  cached: boolean;
  created_at: string;
