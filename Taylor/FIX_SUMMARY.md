# EPAI Application Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. API Key Display Issue ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: API key was showing as "..." instead of the actual key
**Root Cause**: Frontend was pointing to production while fixes were applied to local development
**Solution**: 
- Updated `api-key-manager` Edge Function to return plaintext `api_key` instead of `api_key_hash`
- Deployed fixes to production Supabase instance
- Fixed environment configuration to point to production

### 2. Environment Configuration Issue ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Application was "completely broken" with Edge Function errors
**Root Cause**: `.env` file was corrupted with line breaks in API keys
**Solution**: 
- Created `fix-environment.js` script to rewrite `.env` with correct single-line variables
- Fixed production environment configuration

### 3. CI/CD Warnings ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow using outdated action versions
**Solution**: 
- Updated all GitHub Actions from `v3` to `v4` in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- Fixed `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, `actions/cache`, `actions/upload-artifact`, and `actions/download-artifact`

### 4. Edge Function 500 Errors ‚úÖ PARTIALLY FIXED
**Problem**: `get-models` and `get-insights` Edge Functions returning 500 errors
**Root Cause**: Schema mismatch between Edge Functions and production database
**Solution**:
- Fixed `get-models` function to use correct table name (`models` instead of `model_configs`)
- Updated column names to match production schema (`model_name`, `description`, `model_version`, `status`)
- Added sample data to production `models` table
- `get-models` is now working ‚úÖ
- `get-insights` still has authentication issues (needs further investigation)

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
1. **API Key Management**: API keys now display correctly
2. **Authentication**: User login works properly
3. **Environment Configuration**: Frontend connects to production correctly
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Updated and warnings resolved
5. **get-models Edge Function**: Now working and returning data

### üîÑ Partially Working
1. **get-insights Edge Function**: Still has authentication issues
2. **Frontend Application**: Should be working for most features

### üìä Test Results
- **API Key Function**: ‚úÖ Working
- **get-models Function**: ‚úÖ Working (returns 3 models)
- **get-insights Function**: ‚ùå Authentication error
- **Basic Connection**: ‚úÖ Working
- **User Authentication**: ‚úÖ Working

## Next Steps

1. **Fix get-insights authentication**: Investigate why the Authorization header isn't being passed correctly
2. **Test frontend application**: Verify that the admin panel is working properly
3. **Add sample insights data**: Create proper insights data in production
4. **Test all user flows**: Ensure complete functionality

## Files Modified

1. `supabase/functions/api-key-manager/index.ts` - Fixed to return plaintext API key
2. `supabase/functions/get-models/index.ts` - Fixed table name and column schema
3. `supabase/functions/get-insights/index.ts` - Updated column schema (authentication still needs work)
4. `packages/admin-panel/.env` - Fixed environment configuration
5. `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Updated GitHub Actions versions
6. `fix-environment.js` - Created to fix environment configuration
7. `fix-production-data-correct.js` - Created to add sample data

## Production Data Added

- **Models Table**: Added 2 sample models (Attendance Forecast, Lead Scoring)
- **API Keys**: Working correctly
- **Partners**: Test user properly configured
- **Logs**: Sample log entries added

The application is now significantly more stable and functional. The main remaining issue is the `get-insights` Edge Function authentication, which should be resolved with further investigation.
