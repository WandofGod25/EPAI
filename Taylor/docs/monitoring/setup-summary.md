# Monitoring System Setup Summary

## Components Deployed

### Database Schema
- `notification_channels`: Stores configuration for notification delivery methods
- `alert_definitions`: Stores alert rules, thresholds, and notification targets
- `alert_history`: Records alert trigger events and resolution status
- `notification_logs`: Tracks notification delivery attempts and status
- `security_events`: Stores security-related events for monitoring
- `logs`: Stores API request logs for performance monitoring

### Database Functions
- `check_alerts()`: Evaluates all alert definitions against current system state
- `send_alert_notifications()`: Processes triggered alerts and sends notifications
- `schedule_alerts()`: Main entry point that runs checks and sends notifications

### Alert Categories
1. **Database Alerts**: Monitor database health, performance, and capacity
2. **API Alerts**: Monitor API performance, error rates, and usage patterns
3. **Security Alerts**: Monitor authentication attempts, rate limit violations, and suspicious activities

## Notification Channels
- **Admin Email**: Critical alerts sent to administrator email
- **Team Slack**: All alerts sent to team Slack channel

## Deployment Method
We've implemented a robust deployment method using Supabase migrations:

1. **Migration Files**: Created SQL migration files in the `supabase/migrations` directory
2. **Seed Data**: Generated seed files with initial alert configurations
3. **Deployment Scripts**: Created scripts to apply migrations and seed data

This approach ensures:
- Consistent schema across all environments
- Version-controlled alert definitions
- Reliable deployment process
- Easy rollback capabilities

## Next Steps
1. **Schedule Alert Checks**: Configure a scheduled job to run `SELECT schedule_alerts()` every 5 minutes
2. **Create Monitoring Dashboard**: Set up Grafana dashboard to visualize metrics
3. **Test Alert System**: Trigger test alerts to verify notification delivery
4. **Document Alert Response**: Create runbooks for responding to different alert types

## Maintenance Tasks
- Review alert thresholds monthly and adjust as needed
- Verify notification channel configuration quarterly
- Archive alert history older than 90 days
