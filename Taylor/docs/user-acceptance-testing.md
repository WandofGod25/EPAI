# User Acceptance Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) plan for the Embedded Predictive Analytics Integrator (EPAI) platform. UAT is a critical phase where pilot partners will verify that the system meets their business requirements and functions as expected in real-world scenarios.

## Testing Objectives

1. Verify that the EPAI platform meets partner business requirements
2. Validate the end-to-end functionality from data ingestion to insight display
3. Ensure the platform is user-friendly and intuitive
4. Identify any issues or bugs not caught during development testing
5. Collect feedback for future improvements

## Testing Scope

### In Scope

- Partner onboarding process
- API key management
- Data ingestion API
- Admin Panel functionality
- SDK integration and display
- Documentation and support resources

### Out of Scope

- Backend infrastructure performance testing
- Security penetration testing (covered separately)
- Stress testing and load testing (covered separately)

## Testing Participants

- **Pilot Partners**: 3-5 selected partners who will integrate and test the platform
- **Technical Support Team**: EPAI team members who will support partners during testing
- **Product Team**: EPAI product managers who will collect and analyze feedback
- **Development Team**: EPAI developers who will address any issues identified

## Testing Environment

Partners will test in the production environment with the following safeguards:
- Dedicated test accounts separate from production data
- Rate limiting configured to prevent impact on other users
- Comprehensive monitoring to quickly identify issues
- Backup and rollback procedures in place

## Test Cases

### 1. Partner Onboarding

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| UAT-1.1 | Create new partner account | Partner account is created successfully with default settings |
| UAT-1.2 | Log in to Admin Panel | Partner can log in and access the dashboard |
| UAT-1.3 | View API key | Partner can view their API key in the Settings page |
| UAT-1.4 | Regenerate API key | Partner can regenerate their API key and the old key becomes invalid |

### 2. Data Ingestion

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| UAT-2.1 | Send valid event data | Data is accepted and a 201 status is returned |
| UAT-2.2 | Send invalid event data | Appropriate error message is returned with 400 status |
| UAT-2.3 | Send event with invalid API key | 401 Unauthorized response is returned |
| UAT-2.4 | Send event with missing required fields | Validation error message is returned |
| UAT-2.5 | Send events of different types | All supported event types are processed correctly |

### 3. Admin Panel

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| UAT-3.1 | View logs | Partner can view logs of their API requests |
| UAT-3.2 | Filter logs by date range | Logs are filtered correctly |
| UAT-3.3 | View available models | Partner can see models available to them |
| UAT-3.4 | View insights | Partner can see insights generated from their data |
| UAT-3.5 | View usage statistics | Partner can see their usage statistics |

### 4. SDK Integration

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| UAT-4.1 | Embed SDK using script tag | SDK loads correctly on partner website |
| UAT-4.2 | Customize insight display | Customization options work as expected |
| UAT-4.3 | Display insights in different containers | Insights render correctly in different containers |
| UAT-4.4 | Test SDK on different browsers | SDK works consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge |
| UAT-4.5 | Test SDK on mobile devices | SDK renders correctly on mobile devices |

### 5. Documentation

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| UAT-5.1 | Follow integration guide | Partner can successfully integrate following the documentation |
| UAT-5.2 | Use API reference | API reference accurately describes endpoints and parameters |
| UAT-5.3 | Follow troubleshooting guide | Partner can resolve common issues using the troubleshooting guide |

## Testing Process

### 1. Preparation

- Provide partners with UAT plan and test cases
- Schedule kickoff meeting to explain the testing process
- Ensure partners have access to necessary documentation and support

### 2. Execution

- Partners execute test cases according to the plan
- Partners document results, including any issues encountered
- Support team is available to assist with questions or issues
- Daily check-ins to monitor progress and address blockers

### 3. Issue Reporting

Partners will report issues using the following format:
- Test Case ID
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual result
- Screenshots or videos (if applicable)
- Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### 4. Issue Resolution

- Development team triages reported issues
- Critical and high-severity issues are addressed immediately
- Medium and low-severity issues are documented for future releases
- Partners verify fixes for critical and high-severity issues

### 5. Feedback Collection

In addition to issue reporting, partners will provide feedback on:
- Overall user experience
- Feature completeness
- Documentation quality
- Integration ease
- Suggestions for improvements

## Acceptance Criteria

UAT will be considered successful when:

1. All critical and high-severity issues are resolved
2. Partners have successfully completed all test cases
3. Partners can successfully integrate the SDK into their applications
4. Partners confirm the platform meets their business requirements
5. Partners express satisfaction with the overall experience

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Preparation | 1 week | Distribute test plan, set up accounts, prepare documentation |
| Execution | 2 weeks | Partners execute test cases, report issues |
| Resolution | 1 week | Address critical and high-severity issues |
| Verification | 1 week | Partners verify fixes and provide final feedback |
| Signoff | 1 day | Partners provide formal acceptance |

## Reporting

At the conclusion of UAT, a comprehensive report will be generated including:
- Summary of test results
- List of issues identified and their resolution status
- Partner feedback summary
- Recommendations for improvements
- Overall assessment of platform readiness

## Next Steps

Following successful UAT:
1. Address any remaining medium and low-severity issues
2. Update documentation based on feedback
3. Prepare for general availability release
4. Develop onboarding plan for additional partners
