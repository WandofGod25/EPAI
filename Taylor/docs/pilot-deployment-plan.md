# EPAI Pilot Deployment Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for deploying the Embedded Predictive Analytics Integrator (EPAI) platform to a select group of pilot partners. The pilot phase will allow us to validate the platform's functionality, performance, and security in a controlled production environment before full release.

## Pilot Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Pre-Deployment | Week 1 | Final security testing, environment setup, documentation |
| Initial Deployment | Week 2 | Deploy to production environment, internal testing |
| Partner Onboarding | Week 3-4 | Onboard pilot partners, provide training |
| Active Pilot | Week 5-8 | Partners actively use the platform, collect feedback |
| Evaluation | Week 9 | Analyze feedback, identify improvements |
| Transition | Week 10 | Plan for general availability or additional pilot phases |

## Pilot Partners

We will select 3-5 partners for the pilot phase based on the following criteria:
- Technical capability to integrate with our platform
- Willingness to provide detailed feedback
- Representing different use cases and industries
- Existing relationship with our company

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [x] Complete penetration testing and address any findings
- [x] Set up production monitoring and alerting
- [x] Finalize user documentation and integration guides
- [x] Create partner onboarding materials
- [x] Set up support channels for pilot partners
- [x] Conduct final internal testing

### Deployment

- [x] Deploy database schema to production
- [x] Deploy Edge Functions to production
- [x] Deploy Admin Panel to production
- [x] Configure production security settings
- [x] Verify all components are working correctly
- [x] Set up automated backups
- [x] Test end-to-end functionality in production
- [x] Fix SDK API key header to use 'apikey' instead of 'x-api-key'

### Partner Onboarding

- [ ] Create partner accounts
- [ ] Generate initial API keys
- [ ] Conduct onboarding sessions
- [ ] Provide integration documentation
- [ ] Assist with initial integration
- [ ] Verify successful integration

## Monitoring Plan

During the pilot phase, we will monitor the following metrics:

### Technical Metrics

- API response time
- Error rates
- Database performance
- Resource utilization
- Security events

### Business Metrics

- Number of API calls per partner
- Types of events ingested
- Insights generated
- Partner engagement with the platform
- Time to integration

## Feedback Collection

We will collect feedback from pilot partners through:

1. **Regular Check-ins**: Weekly calls with technical contacts
2. **Surveys**: Structured feedback forms at key milestones
3. **Usage Analytics**: Automated collection of usage patterns
4. **Support Tickets**: Tracking issues and questions

## Success Criteria

The pilot will be considered successful if:

1. All partners successfully integrate the platform
2. API response time remains under 200ms for 95% of requests
3. Error rate remains below 0.1%
4. Partners report positive feedback on ease of integration
5. No critical security issues are identified
6. Partners express interest in continuing to use the platform

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues during the pilot, we will:

1. Identify the scope and impact of the issue
2. Communicate with affected partners
3. Implement a fix if possible
4. If necessary, roll back to a previous stable version
5. Document the issue and resolution for future reference

## Post-Pilot Plan

After the pilot phase, we will:

1. Compile a comprehensive report of findings
2. Prioritize improvements based on feedback
3. Develop a roadmap for general availability
4. Create a transition plan for pilot partners
5. Update documentation based on pilot experience

## Communication Plan

### Internal Stakeholders

- Daily status updates during initial deployment
- Weekly progress reports during the pilot
- Immediate notification of critical issues

### Pilot Partners

- Welcome email with onboarding instructions
- Weekly check-in calls
- Dedicated Slack channel for quick questions
- Regular updates on platform improvements
- End-of-pilot survey and next steps

## Support Plan

During the pilot phase, we will provide:

1. **Dedicated Support Contact**: A technical team member assigned to each pilot partner
2. **Extended Support Hours**: Support available from 8am-8pm on weekdays
3. **Priority Issue Resolution**: Pilot issues prioritized over internal development
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and troubleshooting resources
5. **Office Hours**: Weekly open office hours for questions and assistance

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Integration difficulties | Medium | High | Provide detailed documentation and direct support |
| Performance issues | Low | High | Monitor closely and optimize as needed |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Complete penetration testing before pilot |
| Low partner engagement | Medium | Medium | Regular check-ins and clear value demonstration |
| Data quality issues | Medium | Medium | Provide data validation tools and best practices |

## Conclusion

This pilot deployment plan provides a structured approach to validating the EPAI platform in a production environment with real partners. By carefully monitoring performance, collecting feedback, and addressing issues quickly, we can ensure a successful pilot phase that leads to a smooth general availability launch.
