| Final Review | Oct 16-21, 2024 | Comprehensive review of pilot results |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Partner integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Prepared detailed guides, dedicated support personnel |
| Performance issues at scale | High | Low | Conducted load testing, monitoring system in place |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Completed security testing, monitoring for unusual activity |
| Limited data for meaningful insights | Medium | Medium | Providing sample data sets, lowering initial thresholds |

## Next Steps

1. **Kickoff Meeting**: Schedule virtual kickoff meeting with all pilot partners
2. **Account Creation**: Create accounts for pilot partners using prepared scripts
3. **Onboarding Sessions**: Conduct individual onboarding sessions with each partner
4. **Integration Support**: Provide dedicated technical support during integration phase
5. **Monitoring**: Closely monitor usage and system performance during the pilot

## Conclusion

The EPAI platform is fully ready for the pilot deployment. All technical requirements have been met, and the necessary support infrastructure is in place. The pilot will provide valuable real-world feedback to refine the platform before general availability.
