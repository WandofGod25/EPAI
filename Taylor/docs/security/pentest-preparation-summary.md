# EPAI Security Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the security features implemented in the Embedded Predictive Analytics Integrator (EPAI) platform. It is intended to serve as a reference for the penetration testing team.

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **API Key Authentication**
   - All partner API requests require a valid API key
   - API keys are stored as bcrypt hashes in the database
   - API keys can be revoked and regenerated
   - Invalid API keys return 401 Unauthorized responses

2. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Database tables have RLS policies to ensure partners can only access their own data
   - Access to sensitive tables is restricted to authenticated users with appropriate roles

### API Security

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - IP-based rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - API key-based rate limiting for partner-specific limits
   - Configurable limits for different endpoints

2. **Security Headers**
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
   - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
   - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
   - `Content-Security-Policy` with appropriate directives
   - Proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests

3. **Input Validation**
   - All API inputs are validated using Zod schemas
   - SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
   - XSS protection through input sanitization

### Logging & Monitoring

1. **Security Event Logging**
   - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
   - Rate limit violations
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - API key usage tracking

2. **Audit Trail**
   - Data access and modification events are logged
   - User actions are tracked with timestamps and user IDs

### Data Protection

1. **Data Sanitization**
   - Sensitive information is masked in logs
   - Error messages do not reveal system details

2. **Data Retention**
   - Configurable data retention policies
   - Automated data purging for expired data

## Security Testing

All security features have been tested using an enhanced security testing script that verifies:

1. Rate limiting functionality
2. API key validation
3. Security headers implementation
4. SQL injection protection
5. XSS protection
6. CORS headers configuration

All tests are currently passing, indicating that the basic security measures are functioning as expected.

## Areas for Penetration Testing Focus

We recommend focusing penetration testing efforts on the following areas:

1. **API Key Authentication Bypass**
   - Attempt to bypass API key validation
   - Test for timing attacks on API key validation

2. **Authorization Testing**
   - Attempt to access data belonging to other partners
   - Test for insecure direct object references

3. **Injection Attacks**
   - SQL injection in various endpoints
   - NoSQL injection in document storage
   - Command injection in system utilities

4. **Rate Limiting Bypass**
   - Distributed attacks from multiple IPs
   - Header manipulation to bypass rate limiting

5. **Data Exposure**
   - Test for sensitive data exposure in API responses
   - Check for excessive data in error messages

## Test Environment

A dedicated test environment has been set up for penetration testing with:

1. Sample data that mimics production without exposing sensitive information
2. Test API keys with various permission levels
3. Logging enabled for all security events
