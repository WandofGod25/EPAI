# EPAI Security Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in the EPAI platform. It covers authentication, authorization, data protection, API security, and monitoring.

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication

The EPAI platform uses Supabase Auth for user authentication, which provides:

- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- Email verification
- Password reset functionality
- JWT-based session management
- Protection against common attacks (brute force, CSRF, etc.)

### API Key Authentication

API keys are used to authenticate partner applications:

- Format: `epai_[32+ random characters]`
- Stored as bcrypt hashes in the database
- Automatic expiration after 90 days
- Required rotation after 180 days
- Rate limited to prevent brute force attacks

### Authorization

The EPAI platform uses PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure partners can only access their own data:

- Partners can only view and modify their own data
- API keys are scoped to a specific partner
- Edge Functions validate permissions before processing requests
- Security-critical operations use SECURITY DEFINER functions

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption

All data in the EPAI platform is encrypted:

- Data at rest is encrypted (PostgreSQL/Supabase)
- Data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2+
- API keys are stored as bcrypt hashes
- Sensitive data is masked in logs and error messages

### Data Sanitization

The platform implements data sanitization to protect sensitive information:

- Automatic masking of emails, API keys, and other sensitive data
- Configurable sanitization rules
- Sanitization applied to logs, error messages, and API responses

### Data Retention

The platform implements data retention policies:

- Configurable retention periods for different data types
- Automatic purging of expired data
- Audit trail for all data deletion actions
- GDPR "right to be forgotten" support
- CCPA data anonymization support

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

All API endpoints are rate limited to prevent abuse:

- IP-based rate limiting (default: 30 requests/minute)
- API key-based rate limiting (default: 120 requests/minute)
- Endpoint-specific limits for sensitive operations
- Automatic blocking of suspicious activity

### Input Validation

All input is validated before processing:

- Zod schemas validate all incoming data
- Strong typing throughout the codebase
- Validation errors return detailed information in development, generic in production

### Security Headers

All responses include security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Event Logging

All security events are logged:

- Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
- API key usage
- Rate limit violations
- Security-critical operations
- Data access and modification

### Suspicious Activity Detection

The platform monitors for suspicious activity:

- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Rate limit violations
- Access attempts from unusual locations

### Alerting

The platform includes alerting for security events:

- Real-time alerts for critical security events
- Daily security summary
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Multiple notification channels (email, Slack)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- Never log API keys, even partially
- Always use the `extractApiKey` function to get the API key from a request
- Use the `validateApiKey` function to validate API keys
- Always use RLS policies to restrict data access
- Use `SECURITY DEFINER` functions for operations that need elevated privileges
- Use the `createSecureErrorResponse` function to create error responses
- Never expose stack traces or internal error details in production

### For Administrators

- Use the `setup-prod-env.js` script to configure the production environment
- Store all secrets in environment variables
- Rotate API keys and credentials regularly
- Monitor the `security_events` table for suspicious activity
- Have an incident response plan ready

## Security Roadmap

### Short-term (1-3 months)

- Complete third-party penetration testing
- Implement GDPR/CCPA compliance mechanisms
- Expand automated security testing in CI/CD

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Add IP allowlisting for API access
- Implement more granular permission controls

### Long-term (6-12 months)

- Obtain security certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Implement advanced threat detection
- Conduct regular security training for team members
