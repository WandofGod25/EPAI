# Security Issues Remediation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to address security issues identified during the initial penetration testing of the EPAI platform. These issues must be resolved before proceeding with formal penetration testing by the security team.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Security Headers Not Properly Implemented

**Issues:**
- Missing X-Content-Type-Options header
- Missing X-XSS-Protection header
- Missing X-Frame-Options header
- Missing Content-Security-Policy header
- Missing CORS headers

**Remediation Plan:**
1. Create a security headers middleware for Edge Functions
2. Implement the following headers in all API responses:
   ```
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [configured domains]
   Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
   Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
   ```
3. Test all endpoints to ensure headers are properly applied

### 2. API Key Validation Issues

**Issues:**
- Invalid API key not rejected correctly (status: 503)
- API key validation logic not properly implemented

**Remediation Plan:**
1. Review and fix the API key validation logic in Edge Functions
2. Ensure proper error responses (401 Unauthorized) for invalid API keys
3. Add comprehensive logging for API key validation failures
4. Create a test script to verify API key validation

### 3. SQL Injection Protection Needs Improvement

**Issues:**
- SQL injection in API key parameter not handled correctly

**Remediation Plan:**
1. Review all database queries that accept user input
2. Use parameterized queries consistently throughout the codebase
3. Implement input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
4. Add specific tests for SQL injection protection

## Implementation Timeline

| Task | Assignee | Due Date | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| Create security headers middleware | TBD | TBD | Not Started |
| Fix API key validation logic | TBD | TBD | Not Started |
| Implement SQL injection protection | TBD | TBD | Not Started |
| Create comprehensive test script | TBD | TBD | Not Started |
| Verify all fixes | TBD | TBD | Not Started |

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Testing:** Test each security feature individually
2. **Integration Testing:** Test the security features together
3. **Penetration Testing:** Conduct another round of penetration testing
4. **Verification:** Verify that all issues have been resolved

## Next Steps

1. Assign tasks to team members
2. Implement fixes according to the remediation plan
3. Test and verify all fixes
4. Schedule formal penetration testing with the security team
