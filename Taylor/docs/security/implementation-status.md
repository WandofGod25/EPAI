| Rate Limiting | ✅ Complete | IP-based and API key-based rate limiting implemented |
| Security Headers | ✅ Complete | All required security headers are properly implemented |
| CORS Configuration | ✅ Complete | CORS headers are set correctly for all endpoints |
| SQL Injection Protection | ✅ Complete | Parameterized queries and input validation implemented |
| XSS Protection | ✅ Complete | Input sanitization and CSP headers implemented |
| Security Event Logging | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive logging for security events |
| Data Sanitization | ✅ Complete | Sensitive data is masked in logs and responses |
| Row Level Security | ✅ Complete | RLS policies implemented for all tables |
| Data Retention | ✅ Complete | Configurable data retention policies implemented |

## Testing Status

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Rate Limiting | ✅ Passing | Verified API key validation works correctly |
| Invalid API Key Rejection | ✅ Passing | Returns 401 Unauthorized as expected |
| Valid API Key Acceptance | ✅ Passing | Accepts valid API keys |
| Security Headers | ✅ Passing | All required headers are present and correct |

## Next Steps

1. **Formal Penetration Testing**
   - External security team to conduct comprehensive penetration testing
   - Focus on authentication bypass, authorization testing, and injection attacks

2. **Security Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for security events
   - Implement continuous security monitoring

3. **Regular Security Reviews**
   - Schedule regular security reviews
   - Keep security dependencies up to date
