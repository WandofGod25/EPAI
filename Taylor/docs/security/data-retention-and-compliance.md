# Data Retention & Compliance Implementation Details

**Objective:** Implement data retention and purging policies to ensure compliance with GDPR and CCPA regulations.

**Summary:**
Developed and implemented comprehensive data retention and purging policies for all system data. Created mechanisms for automatic data purging based on configurable retention periods, as well as functions for handling GDPR "right to be forgotten" requests and CCPA data anonymization requests. Implemented a complete audit trail for all data deletion actions.

**Detailed Tasks Completed:**

*   **Data Retention Configuration:**
    *   **Configuration Table:** Created a `data_retention_config` table to store configurable retention periods for different data types.
    *   **Default Policies:** Established default retention periods (logs: 90 days, security events: 365 days, ingestion events and insights: 730 days).
    *   **Admin Interface:** Implemented functions to view and update retention policies.

*   **Automatic Data Purging:**
    *   **Purge Function:** Created the `purge_expired_data()` function to automatically delete data that exceeds its retention period.
    *   **Batch Processing:** Implemented batch processing to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
    *   **Scheduled Execution:** Added commented code for scheduled execution using pg_cron (to be enabled in production).

*   **GDPR/CCPA Compliance:**
    *   **Right to be Forgotten:** Implemented the `delete_partner_data()` function to handle GDPR deletion requests.
    *   **Data Anonymization:** Created the `anonymize_partner_data()` function as an alternative to full deletion for CCPA compliance.
    *   **Complete Data Removal:** Ensured all partner data can be completely removed from all tables.

*   **Audit & Reporting:**
    *   **Deletion Audit:** Created the `data_deletion_audit` table to track all data deletion actions.
    *   **Retention Summary:** Implemented the `get_data_retention_summary()` function to provide an overview of data retention status.
    *   **Testing Script:** Created a comprehensive testing script (`test-data-retention.js`) to validate and manage retention policies.

*   **Documentation:**
    *   **Security Guide:** Updated the security guide with detailed information about data retention policies and compliance mechanisms.
    - **Task Tracking:** Updated the task list to reflect the completion of data retention and purging implementation.
