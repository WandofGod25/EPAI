# EPAI Security Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the security implementation of the EPAI platform.

## Contents

- [Implementation Status](./implementation-status.md): Current status of security features implementation
- [Security Middleware Template](./security-middleware-template.ts): Template for implementing security middleware in Edge Functions

## Security Features

The EPAI platform implements the following security features:

1. **API Key Authentication**: All endpoints require valid API keys for access
2. **Security Headers**: All responses include security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities
3. **CORS Headers**: All endpoints have proper CORS headers to control cross-origin requests
4. **Rate Limiting**: All endpoints have rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. **SQL Injection Protection**: All endpoints have protection against SQL injection
6. **Data Sanitization**: Sensitive data is sanitized before logging
7. **WAF Protection**: Web Application Firewall is enabled and configured

## Security Testing

The security implementation is regularly tested using automated scripts and manual testing. The test results are documented and tracked to ensure that all security features are working correctly.

## Security Best Practices

When developing new features or endpoints, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Use the Security Middleware Template**: Use the provided template for implementing security middleware in Edge Functions
2. **Validate All Input**: Validate all input data before processing
3. **Use Prepared Statements**: Use prepared statements for all database queries
4. **Sanitize Output**: Sanitize all output data to prevent XSS attacks
5. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information
6. **Log Security Events**: Log all security-related events for audit purposes
7. **Limit API Access**: Limit API access to only what is necessary

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident, please follow the incident response procedure outlined in the [Security Incident Response Plan](./incident-response-plan.md).
