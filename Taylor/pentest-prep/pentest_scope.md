# EPAI Penetration Testing Scope Document

## Overview
This document outlines the scope, objectives, and boundaries for the penetration testing of the EPAI (Embedded Predictive Analytics Integrator) platform.

## Target Environment
- **Production URL:** https://epai.example.com
- **Staging URL:** https://staging.epai.example.com
- **Local Development URL:** http://localhost:54321

## In-Scope Components

### 1. API Endpoints
- Authentication endpoints
- Data ingestion endpoints
- Model prediction endpoints
- API key management endpoints
- Partner management endpoints

### 2. Database
- Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Row-level security policies
- Database functions and triggers

### 3. Frontend Applications
- Admin Panel (React)
- SDK Embedding (JavaScript)

### 4. Infrastructure
- Edge Functions
- API Gateway
- Authentication services

## Out-of-Scope Components
- Third-party dependencies and libraries
- Underlying cloud infrastructure (AWS, Supabase)
- Physical security
- Social engineering attacks

## Testing Methodology
1. **Reconnaissance:** Information gathering about the application
2. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities
3. **Manual Testing:** In-depth testing of authentication, authorization, and business logic
4. **Exploitation:** Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities
5. **Reporting:** Document findings and recommendations

## Specific Testing Areas

### Authentication & Authorization
- API key validation and security
- User authentication flows
- Permission boundaries between partners
- JWT token security

### Data Security
- Data validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection
- Cross-site scripting protection
- Cross-site request forgery protection

### API Security
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Input validation
- Error handling and information disclosure
- Business logic vulnerabilities

### Compliance
- GDPR/CCPA data handling compliance
- Data retention policy enforcement
- Audit logging effectiveness

## Deliverables
1. Detailed penetration testing report
2. Executive summary of findings
3. Remediation recommendations
4. Re-testing of critical vulnerabilities after fixes

## Timeline
- Testing Period: 2 weeks
- Report Delivery: Within 1 week of testing completion
- Remediation Period: 2 weeks
- Re-testing: 1 week

## Rules of Engagement
- Testing should not disrupt production services
- No denial of service attacks
- Data should not be exfiltrated
- Testing credentials will be provided
- All testing activity must be logged
