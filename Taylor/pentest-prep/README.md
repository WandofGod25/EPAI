   - Review `test_environment.md` to get access credentials and understand the test data
   - Use `pentest_checklist.md` as a guide during testing
   - Refer to `security_configuration.md` for details on security implementations

2. **For Developers**:
   - Use `preparation_summary.md` to understand what has been prepared for testing
   - Review `security_configuration.md` to understand the security features that need to be implemented

## Running the Tests

To run the penetration tests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary credentials from `test_environment.md`
2. Follow the testing methodology outlined in `pentest_checklist.md`
3. Document all findings with clear reproduction steps
4. Classify vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
5. Provide remediation recommendations

## Reporting
